# Deep_Learning_Specialization
This is a repo to store the programming notebooks and my notes of the 5-course deep learning specialization on Coursera.

#### File Structure

* `notes`: my personal notes and summaries of the coursera
* `resources`: some external files that might be help in understanding certain points in the course.
* `certificates`: my personal course certificates from Coursera.

#### Notice

**Some large files are not in the repo**:

1. model weights `ResNet50.h5` in `Convolutional Neural Networks/Week 2/ResNets/`
2. model weights `yolo.h5` in `Convolutional Neural Networks/Week 3/`
3. video file `pred_video.mp4` and `road_video.mp4` in `Convolutional Neural Networks/Week 3/nb_images/`
4. model weights `imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat` in `Convolutional Neural Networks/Week 4/Neural Style Transfer/pretrained-model/`
5. word embedding `glove.6B.50d.txt` in `Sequence Model/Week 2/Emojify/data` and `Sequence Model/Week 2/Word Vector Representation/data`
6. training dataset `X.npy` in `Sequence Model/Week 3/Trigger Word Detection/XY_train` and dev dataset `X_dev.npy` in `Sequence Model/Week 3/Trigger Word Detection/XY_dev`.

**Please follow the [Coursera honor code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) and use this repo properly.**
